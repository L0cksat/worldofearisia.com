This is a website for my TTRPG (Dungeons &amp; Dragons) campaign world called "Earisia"

### Readme
Hi, this is the Readme for my project website called World of Earisia.com, here I wanted to create a space to be able to log and catalog all of our recorded sessions and be able to create pages which will contain information about the world, NPCs, countries, lore, the players themselves and their characters.
I'll update the Readme as best as I can, when I can.

_To be continued._
